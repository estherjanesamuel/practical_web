# Form Validation

Here is a description of how the form will work:
- There are a total of four text fields. All of them are required. In the event that the text box is not filled when the Submit button is clicked, the box will be outlined in red. On the other hand, where the text box is filled in correctly, it will be outlined in green.
- The email text box checks that the email addresses like i.love_stackup@gmail.com are valid.
- The password entered must be at least five characters. You will need to have a function that checks the length of this input.
- The confirm password text box checks that the entered value matches the value entered in the password text box.
